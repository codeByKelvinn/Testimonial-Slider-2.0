                            The HTML code you used was clean and well-organized, which made it easy to navigate and understand. Your use of CSS was also impressive; the layout was visually appealing, and the site was easy to read and use. I especially appreciated your attention to detail in terms of font size, spacing, and color selection.
                            
                            Your use of JavaScript was also commendable. The interactive features you included, such as hover effects and clickable buttons, were a nice touch and added to the overall user experience.
                            
                            In terms of potential areas for improvement, I would suggest taking a closer look at the website's responsiveness. While the site looked great on a desktop computer, it did not display as well on smaller screens, such as mobile devices.

                            Great work!

Although the website did not include any JavaScript, the developer was able to create a website that was easy to navigate and provided the necessary information about the client's work and experience. They were able to incorporate images, text, and other content into the website in a way that was visually appealing and easy to understand.
